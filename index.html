<p><b>What do I do if I see this?</b></p>
<p>This means WatchUp development is underway/not started yet.</p>
<p>Be sure to check back for development updates below!</p>

<h1>Development has started!</h1>
<p>Currently WatchUp development has started... sort of.</p>
<p>It's not fully started, however I'm looking through</p>
<p>the app files trying to figure out the resolution of</p>
<p>the app, etc. A lot of the stuff is coded into the app</p>
<p>itself, so I need to figure out how to remove a lot of it.</p>
